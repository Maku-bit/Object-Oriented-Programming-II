#python variables
#Variables are containers for storing data
#To create a variable you assign using (=)
#Examples
x=3
w="Alex"
print (x)
print(w)

#A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
#A variable name cannot start with a number
#A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
#Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

#legal variable names
myvar = "Alex"
my_var = "Alex"
_my_var = "Alex"
myVar = "Alex"
MYVAR = "Alex"
myvar2 = "Alex"

#Illegal variable names:
#2myvar = "Alex"
#my-var = "Alex"
#my var = "Alex"


#Assigning multiple Variables
a,b,c = "Banana","Apple","Grapes"
print(a)
print(b)
