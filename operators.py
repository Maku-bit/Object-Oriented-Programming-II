#there are various types of operators;arithmetic operators,assignment operators,relational operators,logical operators,unary operators
#Arithmetic operators
x=4
y=8
print(x+y)
print(y-x)
print(x*y)
print(x/y)
#assignment operators
w=2
w=w+2
print(w)
#or
w+=4
print(w)
w*=2
print(w)

#you can do assignment in one line
x,y,d=2,5,6
print(x,y,d)
#relational operators
#are called relational because you are trying to relate to different values
y<d
print(y<d)
y=6
print(y==d)
x<=y
print(x<=y)
#Not equal to
y!=d
print(y<d)

#to relate and check two conditions
a=3
b=5
print((a<7)and(b<6))

print((a<7)or(b>6))

x=True
print(x)
print(not(x))
x=not x
