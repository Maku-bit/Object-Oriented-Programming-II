#A tuple is similar to a list but the only difference ist that you cant change values in tuples
#A tuple is immutable
#To set a tuple we use round brackets()
tup=(30,35,45,10,6)
print (tup)

#To check index of a tuple we use square brackets
tup[2]
print (tup[2])

#There ere only 2 methods in tuple;count and index to find index


#sets
#to create  a set we use {}

s= {22,11,33,55,66,44}
#sets dont follow the sequence in which elements are added
